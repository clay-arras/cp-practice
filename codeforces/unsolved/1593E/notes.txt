solution (wrong):

- loop through the tree and find all leaves, and store in vector
- loop through the leaves. keep a array called maxTime, which is the latest that node will last
- dfs, where maxTime is updated according to depth from leaf (MAX)
- loop through maxTime and count number of indices > k

problem side:
- if you get the diameter of the tree that passes through point i, then the length of the shorter end is the time it would take

- assume nodes where n=1 are LEAVES, n=2 are BRANCHES, and n=3+ are HUBS
- we dfs until we run into a HUB. hubs are ONLY complete when deg-1 BRANCHES have ???
- then for each completed hub, we continue until we run into another hub. add it to the processing list if complete (leaves)
- when are hubs complete???

solution side:
