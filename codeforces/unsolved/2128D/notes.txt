pivot: what if dp[i] is the total sum of all subarrays STARTING at i?
ans: [9, 5, 2, 1]

terms:
- 1: to count the new subarray starting at r
- (N-1-r)*((p[r+1] > p[r+2]) + 0 + (p[r] > p[r+1])): N-1-r means if N-1 then 0, N-2 then 1, N-3 then 2

core assumption: given a subarray and you are trying to expand it by 2, then you only need to look at the first subarray value to get the largest value in the decreasing sequence



---

what are common patterns with subarrays

solution side:
- pattern: dp w/ n^2, s.t, we do dp[l][r] = length
- get answer: we loop over l and r and sum up all the values
- extension: loop over r, then go backwards for l. for each r, need to do 2 values for parity to cover all of it

problem side:
- if we have i+2's length, then if we extend the subarray to the left by 2, we have dp[i] = 1 + (pi > pi+2)
- claim: given a subsequence w/ descending, you only have to look at the left two items to get their biggest value


case study:
p1 p2 p3 p4
max(p1, p2) > p3
max(p2, p3) > p4

if p1 is small
p2 > p3
p2 > p4
then 2 + (p3 > p4)

if p1 is big and p2 is small
p1 > p3
p3 > p4

if p1 is big and p2 is med
p1 > p2
