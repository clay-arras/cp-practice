step 1: do coordinate compression
step 2: compute two difference arrays that encapsulate the x and y bounds
step 3: because they're rectangles we guarantee that if an x range has
N-1 rectangles AND a y range has N-1 rectangles, then their intersection
is going to be a coordinate where N-1 rectangles cross
step 4: undo coordinate compression


notes: this N-1 thing is super sussy, solution has to do with it FS

pattern: process x and y separately (instead of 2d, process 2 1ds)
pattern: process each point and assume its the -1 in the N-1 required
